Description: Detect Differential Clustering of Genomic Sites such as
    gene therapy integrations.  The package provides some functions
    for exploring genomic insertion sites originating from two
    different sources. Possibly, the two sources are two different
    gene therapy vectors.  Vectors are preferred that target
    sensitive regions less frequently, motivating the search for
    localized clusters of insertions and comparison of the clusters
    formed by integration of different vectors.  Scan statistics
    allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and
    calculation of False Discovery Rates (FDRs) providing
    statistical methods for comparing retroviral vectors. A scan
    statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window
    widths to detect clustering differentials and compute FDRs is
    implemented here.
